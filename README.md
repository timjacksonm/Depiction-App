## **How to run the project**

Two Options Available

<details>
<summary>Expo Go app for IOS and Android (fastest method)</summary>
The fastest way to get up and running is to use the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device. Expo Go allows you to open up apps that are being served through Expo CLI.

- ü§ñ Android Play Store: (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) - Android Lollipop (5) and greater.
- üçé iOS App Store: (https://itunes.com/apps/exponent) - iOS 11 and greater.

When the Expo Go app is finished installing, open it up. If you created an account with expo-cli then you can sign in here on the "Profile" tab. This will make it easier for you to open projects in the client when you have them open in development ‚Äî they will appear automatically in the "Projects" tab of the client app.
